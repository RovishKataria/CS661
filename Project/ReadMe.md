Final Class Project: What is Expected?
 + You will build a visual-analytics interface/software to solve a problem from an application domain.
 + You are expected to have knowledge about your domain of application and the tasks you have picked must reflect that.
 + Your tasks should be meaningful, and you should be able to explain why you are doing something.
 + You should be able to tell a coherent story about your data through your visualization interface.
 + Random set of plots will not work.
 + You need to justify why you picked certain type of plots over others, i.e., design aspects of the tool.
 + You are expected to show meaningful patterns from your data through your interface.
 + Since this is a visualization focused course, so even if you do a very sophisticated modeling, your visualization interface still will be the focus for grading.
 + How you are presenting your results will matter.
 + You are expected to write a comprehensive report of your work that describes the details of the methodologies and visualization techniques that you have used.
 + You should justify your design choices for your interface. Such as: Why a bar chart and not a Pie chart!

Final Class Project: How Will It be Graded?
 + Grading will be done on your overall idea, quality of work, final presentation, and report.
 + Grading will be done for individual group members.
 + Total marks: 300
 + Overall quality: 100
 + Presentation: 100
 + Report: 100
 + Your group will have to give a presentation + individual Q&A
