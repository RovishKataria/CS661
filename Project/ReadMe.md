Final Class Project: What is Expected?
• You will build a visual-analytics interface/software to solve a problem from an application domain.
• You are expected to have knowledge about your domain of application and the tasks you have picked must reflect that.
• Your tasks should be meaningful, and you should be able to explain why you are doing something.
• You should be able to tell a coherent story about your data through your visualization interface.
• Random set of plots will not work.
• You need to justify why you picked certain type of plots over others, i.e., design aspects of the tool.
• You are expected to show meaningful patterns from your data through your interface.
• Since this is a visualization focused course, so even if you do a very sophisticated modeling, your visualization interface still will be the focus for grading.
• How you are presenting your results will matter.
• You are expected to write a comprehensive report of your work that describes the details of the methodologies and visualization techniques that you have used.
• You should justify your design choices for your interface. Such as: Why a bar chart and not a Pie chart!
