Main Project Theme
"How Government Policies, Testing, and Vaccination Affected Mobility and COVID-19 Spread Globally"

✅ Key Ideas & Visualization Themes
1. Global Mobility Trends Over Time
📊 Visualization: Line plot of trend over time (aggregated or by continent).

🎯 Why: Sets the foundation by showing how movement behavior changed over the pandemic timeline.

2. Mobility vs New COVID-19 Cases
📊 Visualization: Dual-axis line chart or scatter plot (x = trend, y = new_cases_per_million).

🎯 Why: Analyzes how reduced/increased movement relates to case surges.

3. Mobility and Government Policy Severity
📊 Visualization: Line plot of trend vs stringency_index or individual policies (e.g., c1m_school_closing).

🎯 Why: Measures policy effectiveness and public adherence using mobility.

4. Country-wise or Region-wise Comparison
📊 Visualization: Bar chart or facet grid of average trend by country or continent.

🎯 Why: Highlights which regions recovered mobility faster or saw more lockdowns.

5. Testing Rates vs Mobility
📊 Visualization: Line or scatter plot: new_tests_per_thousand vs trend.

🎯 Why: Higher testing may have enabled relaxed mobility restrictions.

6. Vaccination Progress and Mobility Rebound
📊 Visualization: Line plot: people_vaccinated_per_hundred vs trend over time.

🎯 Why: Evaluates if higher vaccination helped mobility return to normal.

7. Impact of Booster Doses
📊 Visualization: Compare countries with high vs low total_boosters_per_hundred and their trend.

🎯 Why: Bonus insight into post-vaccine behavior shifts.

8. Country-Level Mobility Timeline Explorer
🧭 Visualization: Interactive Streamlit component (dropdown to select country, date range slider).

🎯 Why: Gives flexibility to dig deeper in demo — great for Q&A and engagement.

🧠 Bonus Ideas (if you want to go further)
📍 Geospatial Mobility Heatmap: Using latitude/longitude for regional mobility levels.

🔁 Pre/Post Policy Effect Analysis: Before/after plot for specific policy dates.

🧩 Correlation Matrix: Between trend, new_cases, policies, and vaccinations.



 1. Overview of Datasets and Columns
Below is a summary of the datasets you used and the relevant columns extracted for analysis:

📍 google_mobility.csv
Column	Meaning
country	Name of the country
date	Date of observation
trend	Percentage change in mobility compared to baseline
✅ Why needed: Central to your task. This shows how people's movement changed during the pandemic.

📍 spread.csv
Column	Meaning
new_cases, new_deaths	Daily new cases/deaths
new_cases_per_million, new_deaths_per_million	Normalized values
total_cases_per_million, total_deaths_per_million	Cumulative normalized cases/deaths
✅ Why needed: To analyze how mobility relates to COVID-19 spread.

📍 testing.csv
Column	Meaning
total_tests, new_tests	Cumulative and daily testing
new_tests_per_thousand	Normalized testing volume
✅ Why needed: Check if increased testing affected or followed mobility changes.

📍 vaccinations_global.csv
Column	Meaning
people_vaccinated_per_hundred, people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred	% of population vaccinated
total_boosters_per_hundred	Booster dose coverage
daily_people_vaccinated_smoothed_per_hundred	Daily smoothed vaccination rate
rolling_vaccinations_6m_per_hundred, rolling_vaccinations_12m_per_hundred	Vaccination trends over time
✅ Why needed: Study the effect of vaccination progress on mobility changes.

📍 oxcgrt_policy.csv
Column	Meaning
c1m_school_closing, c2m_workplace_closing, c6m_stay_at_home_requirements, c7m_restrictions_on_internal_movement	Core policy indicators affecting mobility
stringency_index, containment_health_index, stringency_index_weighted_average	Composite indices measuring policy severity
✅ Why needed: To observe if and how strict policies affected mobility.

📍 countries.csv
Column	Meaning
latitude, longitude, isocode	Useful for mapping mobility geographically
✅ Why needed: Optional for geographic plots or merging standard country codes.



🌟 2. Key Ideas, Visualization Themes, and Plot Justification
Here are the visualization ideas you can implement, with clear justifications on why that specific plot was chosen:

📈 1. Global Mobility Trends Over Time
Goal: Understand how mobility changed over the pandemic.

Plot Type: Line plot

Why line plot?: Best for time-series trends. Shows peaks, dips, lockdown periods clearly.

Why not bar/pie?: Bar would clutter with too many dates. Pie is not for time-series at all.

🌍 2. Mobility Trends by Continent
Goal: Compare regional mobility recovery patterns.

Plot Type: Line plot with hue="continent"

Why line plot?: Clean comparison across time per continent.

Why not bar?: Too many time points, would be unreadable.

🦠 3. Mobility vs. New COVID Cases
Goal: Correlate rising cases with mobility behavior.

Plot Type: Scatter plot

Why scatter?: Perfect to visualize relationships and correlation between two numerical variables.

Why not line?: Doesn't show correlation strength directly.

🧪 4. Mobility vs. Testing Rates
Goal: See if more testing encourages or discourages movement.

Plot Type: Scatter plot

Why scatter?: Explore direct relationships between trend and new_tests_per_thousand.

💉 5. Mobility vs. Vaccination Progress
Goal: Analyze if vaccination increases people's willingness to move.

Plot Type: Line + scatter or jointplot

Why?: Shows before/after impact of full vaccination milestones on mobility.

🛑 6. Policy Stringency vs. Mobility
Goal: Check if stricter policies reduced movement.

Plot Type: Scatter with regression line (seaborn regplot)

Why scatter?: Ideal for showing inverse correlation between stringency_index and trend.

📊 7. Distribution of Mobility Changes
Goal: Understand how mobility varied (extreme, normal, skewed?).

Plot Type: Histogram + KDE

Why histogram?: Best for analyzing distribution and spotting skewness.

Why not pie?: Can't show distributions or variation intensity.

📌 8. Mobility + Vaccination + Policy Over Time (Combined Timeline)
Goal: A high-level timeline plot for story-building.

Plot Type: Multi-line plot or area plot

Why multi-line?: You can show vaccination progress, mobility, and policy in the same time frame to show interactions.
