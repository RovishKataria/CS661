🌟 2. Key Ideas, Visualization Themes, and Plot Justification
Here are the visualization ideas you can implement, with clear justifications on why that specific plot was chosen:

📈 1. Global Mobility Trends Over Time
Goal: Understand how mobility changed over the pandemic.

Plot Type: Line plot

Why line plot?: Best for time-series trends. Shows peaks, dips, lockdown periods clearly.

Why not bar/pie?: Bar would clutter with too many dates. Pie is not for time-series at all.

🌍 2. Mobility Trends by Continent
Goal: Compare regional mobility recovery patterns.

Plot Type: Line plot with hue="continent"

Why line plot?: Clean comparison across time per continent.

Why not bar?: Too many time points, would be unreadable.

🦠 3. Mobility vs. New COVID Cases
Goal: Correlate rising cases with mobility behavior.

Plot Type: Scatter plot

Why scatter?: Perfect to visualize relationships and correlation between two numerical variables.

Why not line?: Doesn't show correlation strength directly.

🧪 4. Mobility vs. Testing Rates
Goal: See if more testing encourages or discourages movement.

Plot Type: Scatter plot

Why scatter?: Explore direct relationships between trend and new_tests_per_thousand.

💉 5. Mobility vs. Vaccination Progress
Goal: Analyze if vaccination increases people's willingness to move.

Plot Type: Line + scatter or jointplot

Why?: Shows before/after impact of full vaccination milestones on mobility.

🛑 6. Policy Stringency vs. Mobility
Goal: Check if stricter policies reduced movement.

Plot Type: Scatter with regression line (seaborn regplot)

Why scatter?: Ideal for showing inverse correlation between stringency_index and trend.

📊 7. Distribution of Mobility Changes
Goal: Understand how mobility varied (extreme, normal, skewed?).

Plot Type: Histogram + KDE

Why histogram?: Best for analyzing distribution and spotting skewness.

Why not pie?: Can't show distributions or variation intensity.

📌 8. Mobility + Vaccination + Policy Over Time (Combined Timeline)
Goal: A high-level timeline plot for story-building.

Plot Type: Multi-line plot or area plot

Why multi-line?: You can show vaccination progress, mobility, and policy in the same time frame to show interactions.


1. Global Mobility Trends Over Time
What it tells:
This line chart shows the average global mobility level over time during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Insight:
It reveals significant drops during lockdown periods (e.g., early 2020), gradual recoveries, and periods of plateau, showing how the world responded in mobility to changing pandemic conditions.

2. Single Country Mobility and COVID Spread
What it tells:
Compares one country’s mobility trends with COVID-19 case numbers over time.
Insight:
Shows whether stricter mobility restrictions correlated with reduced COVID spread, or when mobility returned as cases declined.

3. Single Country Mobility vs Stringency
What it tells:
Juxtaposes mobility trends with the government’s stringency index (lockdown intensity).
Insight:
Helps assess how strictly implemented policies impacted movement — for example, high stringency often aligns with sharp drops in mobility.

4. Heatmap of Mobility by Country and Month
What it tells:
Shows average mobility level across countries and months.
Insight:
Highlights which countries had the most or least movement in specific months. Great for identifying hot zones or long-term lockdown areas.

5. Scatter Plot: Mobility vs COVID Cases
What it tells:
Visual correlation between average mobility and average new cases across countries.
Insight:
Assesses whether higher mobility led to more spread — useful to validate or question government strategies.

6. Vaccination Rates vs Mobility
What it tells:
Compares full vaccination rates and mobility per country.
Insight:
See if countries with higher vaccination saw quicker mobility recovery. Good for understanding public trust and health policy effects.

7. Policy Stringency vs Mobility Recovery
What it tells:
Plots government stringency index against mobility recovery.
Insight:
Was stricter policy more effective? Did it delay recovery? This answers it quantitatively.

8. Multi-Country Mobility Comparison
What it tells:
Direct comparison of trends in selected countries.
Insight:
Visualizes differences in recovery patterns — e.g., some countries bounced back faster due to policy, vaccines, or economic reasons.

9. World Map of Mobility Trends
What it tells:
Choropleth map showing average mobility per country.
Insight:
A global snapshot that’s instantly interpretable — perfect for showing geographic disparity and summarizing large data.
